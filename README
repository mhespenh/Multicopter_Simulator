Usage:
        Compile both SimMotor and Multicopter_Simulator
        Make sure you change the PATH to the SimMotor binary in the constructor
            in MulticopterSimulator.cpp to match your directory structure!
        Run Multicopter_Simulator from the command line and enjoy

Changelog:

Notes:
	Apparently there is non-trivial delay when connecting to the dbus, that is why I
	have the motor process emiting a "started" signal over the dbus, otherwise we have
	no idea if/when the process has successfully connected to the bus.  That was fun to
	figure out...
