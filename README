Usage:
        Compile both SimMotor and Multicopter_Simulator
        Make sure you change the PATH to the SimMotor binary in the constructor
            in MulticopterSimulator.cpp to match your directory structure 
	(line 45 MulticopterSimulator.cpp)!
        Run Multicopter_Simulator from the command line (it will start 
	instances of SimMotors as needed automagically)

	Compile and run MulticopterGUI
		See README in that repo for more details about the GUI

Notes:
	You can vary the number of motors by changing the value passed in the
	main file of MulticopterSimulator (default is 4).  Note that changing
	this value may make the craft unstable/unflyable

	You can also change the armLength (changes stability), mass, and gravity
	using setArmLength(float), setMass(float), setGravity(float) in main.
